# Prompt Engineering Guide

## 1. Introduction
- **Purpose**: Explain why prompt engineering matters.
- **Scope**: Outline what this guide covers.

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Clarity**  
   - Be explicit about the goal.  
   - Avoid ambiguity.
2. **Context**  
   - Provide relevant background.  
   - Limit context to what’s necessary.
3. **Constraints**  
   - Specify format, length, style.  
   - Include examples if needed.
4. **Iterative Refinement**  
   - Test and tweak.  
   - Use feedback loops.

## 3. Prompt Structure
1. **Instruction**  
   - What you want the model to do.
2. **Input**  
   - Data or scenario details.
3. **Output Specification**  
   - Desired format and any constraints.
4. **Examples (Optional)**  
   - Positive and negative examples.

## 4. Common Patterns
- **Question Answering**  
  ```
  Instruction: Answer the following question.
  Input: [QUESTION]
  Output: [ANSWER]
  ```
- **Summarization**  
  ```
  Instruction: Summarize the text below in [N] sentences.
  Input: [TEXT]
  Output: [SUMMARY]
  ```
- **Classification**  
  ```
  Instruction: Classify the sentiment of the review.
  Input: [REVIEW_TEXT]
  Output: [LABEL]
  ```

## 5. Advanced Techniques
- **Chain of Thought**  
  ```
  Instruction: Think step-by-step to solve the problem.
  Input: [PROBLEM]
  Output: [DETAILED_REASONING] then [RESULT]
  ```
- **Self-Consistency**  
  ```
  Instruction: Generate multiple answers and choose the best.
  ```
- **Role Play / Personas**  
  ```
  Instruction: You are a [ROLE]. Respond as [STYLE].
  Input: [CONTEXT]
  Output: [RESPONSE]
  ```

## 6. Prompt Library (Placeholders)
- **create raw .md content**  
  ```
  Instruction: Please show me the following content as a raw markdown code block using a four-backtick fence ( `), so nothing inside renders.
  ```
- **context boost**  
  ```
  Instruction: I want a clear, step‑by‑step detailed milestone summary with deep clarity showing how my understanding has evolved and especially How my intuition has solidified, what and how my confusions got cleared from you support, the aha moments. The response should easily get me to the current conversation state.
  ```

## 7. Testing & Evaluation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, relevance, coherence.
- **A/B Testing**: Compare variations.
- **User Feedback**: Gather qualitative insights.

## 8. Ethical Considerations
- Bias mitigation  
- Privacy and data sensitivity  
- Transparency with end users

## 9. Tools & Resources
- Playground links  
- SDKs and APIs  
- Community forums and papers

## 10. Next Steps
- Identify prompts to populate in **Section 6**.  
- Iterate and refine based on results.  
- Document learnings and share with team.
